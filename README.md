# ⌨️ Code Typing Practice Tool

This is an in-browser code typing practice tool designed to help developers improve their speed, accuracy, and fluency when typing real code.

It simulates the experience of a code editor, with syntax highlighting and indentation support, and optionally skips comment lines to focus on writing meaningful logic.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Paste your own code snippets (supports any language)
- ✅ Syntax highlighting via [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/)
- ✅ Live stats: WPM, accuracy, errors, and progress
- ✅ Auto-indent handling with Tab and Enter
- ✅ Option to **ignore comment lines** (`#`, `//`) to improve typing flow
- ✅ Supports multiple languages including Ruby, JavaScript, Python, C++, Java, Go, HTML, etc.

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Open the `typing_practice_tool_ignore_comments.html` file in your browser.
2. Paste your code into the textarea.
3. Select the language for syntax highlighting.
4. (Optional) Check **Ignore comment lines** if you want to skip typing comments.
5. Press **Start Practice** to begin.
6. Use your keyboard to type the code shown, just like in a real editor.
7. Press `Esc` to stop at any time.

## 💡 Motivation

Many typing tools focus on plain text. This project focuses on improving muscle memory for **code**, especially with real-world formatting like tabs, indentation, and symbols.
